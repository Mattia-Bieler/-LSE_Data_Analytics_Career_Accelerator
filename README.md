The London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) Data Analytics Career Accelerator has been a transformative experience, providing me with the essential skills and knowledge to spearhead data-informed decision-making across diverse industries. Over the intensive 6-month duration of the program, I have acquired a comprehensive skill set in data analytics, encompassing sophisticated databases and a variety of analytical tools.

A pivotal aspect of my advancement centered around the enhancement of my coding skills, where I diligently honed my proficiency in programming languages. This involved the practical application of coding to real-world data projects within a business context. Moreover, the program played a crucial role in refining my communication skills. I adeptly translated intricate data insights into captivating visualisations and effectively conveyed impactful recommendations through dynamic video presentations and comprehensive reports.

Structured around three core courses and a group employer project, the program facilitated the creation of a robust portfolio (https://www.bulbapp.com/Mattia-Bieler/portfolio) that effectively highlights my newfound skills and competencies.
